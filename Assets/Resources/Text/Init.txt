Cancerize!# Cancer Cell number grows per second, and is reduced by immune system resistance. You can invade an organ if your cancer cell number is greater than its resistance, you will get all its traits and lose cell number by its resistance number. You can build 2 structures for each organ you invaded, each structure cost 250 energy points to build. The mutation structure allows you to choose a special perk. Everytime you invade a new organ, an event with beneficial effects or harmful effects would be triggered.
