Surgery For Cancer#  The cancer cell numberand cancer cell generation speed are halved, yet the immune system resistance is halved as well. The main goal of surgery to treat cancer is to completely remove the tumour or cancerous tissue from a specific place in the body. Surgery is most effective at completely removing cancer that is at an early stage, is only in the place where it started (localized) and hasnâ€™t spread to other parts of the body.
